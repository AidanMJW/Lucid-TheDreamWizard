Used to light up only certain sprites used in your scene.

In the inspector set spriteLight as the material of the spriterenderer component for the item you want to light up/darken.

Add the adjustableLight prefab to the camera used to view the item you want to light up/darken (usually the camera that follows the player)

Changing the light intensity will only affect the lighting of the items using the spriteLight
